    <h2 class = "yellow">The What:</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The PLL or the Premier Lacrosse League is a profeesional lacrosse league that was made for the players by the players. </p>
        <br>
    <h2 class = "yellow">The Why:</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The reason behind the formation of this league was because of professional lacrosse players who were done seeing little to no growth in the current league they were playing the MLL. Paul Rabil and Kyle Harrison were some of the big names who decided to take this dream of a growing professional lacrosse league where players could actaully earn a good salary and embrace the competition of lacrosse, into reality </p>
        <br>
    <h2 class = "yellow">The How:</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The PLL operates differently than other leagues such as the MLL or NLL and breaks the rules of a traditional sports League. For it's first season there were only 6 teams who competed in the League but these teams, like a traditional league, aren't connected to a city. The league is on the road and travels across the U.S and Canada to perform in front of different cities across the country playing in big well known stadiums. </p>
